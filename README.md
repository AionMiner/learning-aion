# Learning Aion

This repository contains a collection of projects designed to help you get to grips with the Aion Network and its eco-system. While all the projects have a similar structure, each has a slightly separate setup process so make sure to take a look at the `readme.io` file within each of the folders.

This repository is absolutely **not** a replacement for the official [Aion Docs](beta-docs.aion.network). These projects are intended to supplement your learning, and give you the push you need to start building your own projects!

## I'm Stuck

If you're having issues with one of the projects, you can ask for help in either the [issues section](https://github.com/mohnjatthews/learning-aion/issues), on over on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aion) using the `aion` tag.
